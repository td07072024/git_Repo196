Northern muriqui are frugivorous and folivorous, but they also rely on seeds, flowers, nectar, bark, twigs, stems, vines and soil to supplement additional nutritional needs.[9][6][10] Northern muriqui consume the fruits of Margaritaria nobilis, Andira species, Anadenanthera species, Plathymenia foliolosa, Palicourea tetraphylla, Psychotria wamingii, Genipa americana and Carpotroche brasiliensis, as well as the seeds of Mabea fistulifera.[10] The amount of what each group eats depends on seasonality, wherein they will consume foods higher in calories, which results in higher fruit consumption during the wet season, and increased leaf consumption in the dry season.[11] This affect how groups of B. hypoxanthus travel as they forage for food, as bigger family groups need to travel further to attain adequate food sources. The muriqui also utilize vertical niches when foraging, as they can access all levels of forest, from the floor to the canopy. Muriqui group home ranges overlap, so unrelated groups of muriqui will avoid each other by traveling to or foraging for food by using these niche levels.
