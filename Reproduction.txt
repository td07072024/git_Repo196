The Northern muriqui's reproductive cycle is based on the seasonality of their environment. Infants are generally born during the dry season so that when there is a high amount of fruit production during the wet season, they can access calorie dense foods as they are weaned off of their mothers milk.[11] Females will on average be ready to mate at the age of nine, wherein they can copulate with several partners in order to conceive, however, some males can be shown preferential treatment by females.[8] Evidence points to having multiple partners in order to confuse paternity, limit male aggression, or improving odds of fertilization.[18] The gestation period for northern muriquis is a little over 7 months. The visual determination of sex can be seen within a week or so of birth, based on the shape and positioning of their genitalia.[19] There is no definitive research on the average life span of the northern muriqui, there are documented individuals reaching past the age of 30 years of age.
