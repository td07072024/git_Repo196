Northern muriquis exhibit features that allow them to utilize all of their limbs and tail for travel and obtaining food items. As they spend much of their life in the canopy of forests, they use brachiation as a form of locomotion utilizing all four limbs and their tail.[6] Evolutionary features that further aid these large atelids are elongated hook-like fingers, and shoulder that allows for a wide range of movement.[4] As these monkeys are primarily suited for life in trees, they still venture down to the ground to drink from water sources, consume soil or to obtain ripe fruit that has fallen.[6] Northern muriquis can be individually recognized by their natural markings and facial features, such as fur color and patterning, ear shape, and face shape and pigmentation.[7] Although southern muriqui exhibit sexual dimorphism in canine length, northern muriqui show none. In another difference, northern muriqui retain vestigial thumbs that are completely absent in their sister species.
