Northern muriqui live in egalitarian, fission-fusion societies,[12] where the males are philopatric, and females will leave the natal group to join other muriqui groups at an average age of 6 years old before they reach puberty.[13] Male muriqui have been documented to form social cliques within their natal groups, with groups that are differentiated between older males and younger males.[14] Males display tendencies to form cooperative associations between cliques, and therefore leads to diminished intragroup conflicts compared to other species of primate. These tendencies make themselves apparent during mating season as there is little to no aggression displayed between males vying for mating opportunities, or when dealing with other natal groups of muriqui when traveling or defending their own homerange.[14] Different muriqui groups will interact with each other as group home ranges overlap.[12] During these interactions, females can enter new groups by vocalizing and interacting with new group members by hugging or touching them. Female muriquis are more independent than males; they leave their natal groups at an age of about six years.[15] Male muriquis have almost no interaction with infants. When there is an interaction between the two, the infant would be the one to initiate it.[16] Muriqui social groups are dominated by females, and males will continue to associate closely with their mothers into adulthood. It is through their mothers that adult males gain access to more females.
